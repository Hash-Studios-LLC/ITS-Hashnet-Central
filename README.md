## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can follow the installation guides on their respective websites.

## Building the Website

To build the documentation website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will start a local development server and open the website in your default browser. As you make changes to the source files, the site will automatically reload.

5. Build the static site:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

    This command generates the static files for the website in the `build` directory.

6. Serve the static site locally (optional):

    ```bash
    yarn serve
    ```

    This command starts a local server to serve the static files in the `build` directory.

## Commands

Here are some useful commands for working with this project:

- `yarn install`: Install project dependencies
- `yarn start`: Start the development server
- `yarn build`: Generate static files for the website
